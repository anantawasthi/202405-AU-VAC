In Pandas, you can convert text to date using the `to_datetime()` function and then extract date components using various methods available for datetime objects. Let's walk through an example:

### Example: Converting Text to Date and Extracting Date Components

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame with text dates
data = {'Date': ['2022-01-01', '2022-02-15', '2022-03-30']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert text dates to datetime objects
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Extract date components
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
df['Day'] = df['Date'].dt.day
df['Day_of_Week'] = df['Date'].dt.dayofweek
df['Day_of_Week_Name'] = df['Date'].dt.day_name()

print("DataFrame with Date Components:")
print(df)
```

This code snippet does the following:

1. Creates a sample DataFrame with text dates in the 'Date' column.
2. Converts the text dates to datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime()`.
3. Extracts various date components such as year, month, day, day of the week, and day name using the `dt` accessor.
4. Adds the extracted date components as new columns to the DataFrame.

Output:

```
        Date  Year  Month  Day  Day_of_Week Day_of_Week_Name
0 2022-01-01  2022      1    1            5          Saturday
1 2022-02-15  2022      2   15            1           Tuesday
2 2022-03-30  2022      3   30            2         Wednesday
```

As you can see, the text dates have been successfully converted to datetime objects, and various date components have been extracted and added as new columns to the DataFrame. This allows for further analysis and manipulation of date-time data in Pandas.
